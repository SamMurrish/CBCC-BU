  <p class="teacherParagraphIndent">I grew up in a military family and spent the majority of my formative years living in Europe. It was an incredible experience and I am forever grateful to my parents for that opportunity. When my father retired from the Air Force we moved back to Florida as both of my parents are Florida Natives. I attended Brevard Community College in Cocoa and earned my Associate of Arts degree and also became a certified Emergency Medical Technician. While attending school I met the love of my life, Will. We have been married for almost 18 years and have two sons, Trey and Wesley.</p>
  <p class="teacherParagraphIndent">As newlyweds we lived in Orlando and I found a job that made practical use of my EMT training. I became a supervisor at a medical transcription company and taught myself how to transcribe reports while working the night shift. This ability afforded me the opportunity to be both a stay-at-home mom and gainfully employed. Typing emergency room charts kept me interested in medicine and fueled the desire to further my education.</p>
  <p class="teacherParagraphIndent">Our young family moved to Georgia in the fall of 2000 as my husband pursued his career in Engineering. We settled in Newnan just southwest of Atlanta and spent the next decade there. I attended the University of West Georgia and earned a
  Bachelor of Science in Pre- Professional Biology as I aspired to go to medical school. While I did not get accepted at that time into graduate school, my love for science was strengthened and my faith in God the Creator was reaffirmed. With every biology, chemistry and
  physics class that I studied for, God's design for life and a highly ordered universe continued to reveal itself in a most magnificent way. Science is amazing! We are truly fearfully and wonderfully made and the Earth is filled with His Glory!</p>
  <p class="teacherParagraphIndent">In February of 2010 we made our way back to Merritt Island. It is our home and we love living here. We have made so many new friends, reconnected with some old ones and are blessed to have so many family members close by.</p>
  <p class="teacherParagraphIndent">Recently, while contemplating a return to graduate school and pondering the ever approaching empty nest stage, I decided that I needed to revisit my college textbooks and refresh my memory. I knew I needed a way to keep my mind sharp and help retain all that I had learned as an undergraduate. That very week while at co-op I was asked if I would be interested in teaching Chemistry and General Science! I am incredibly grateful for this teaching opportunity that God has provided and am so excited for the upcoming school year.</p>
