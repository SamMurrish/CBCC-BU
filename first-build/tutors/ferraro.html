  <h4 class="teacherHeading">My Testimony:</h4>
   <p class="teacherParagraphIndent">My husband went to a Ligonier Ministry conference in the early 90's. I stayed home with our baby. When he came home and told me about the conference, one of the things he mentioned was that during worship, there was a woman that moved her hands like a ballet to the words. I was so touched by his description of the event that I went to the local library, checked out a signing dictionary and started teaching myself to sign. My only purpose was for worship songs. I quickly discovered that this led me to study the words I was singing to God and to broaden my focus to scripture, everyday life vocabulary and teaching our baby girl sign language. This is way before "baby sign." I also found that it helped me to remember things through visual & tactical learning.</p>
   <p class="teacherParagraphIndent">One church we attended offered classes and I took the "Joy of Signing" class, which ended in selecting a song and signing it for the class. Later, I took a class from the signing ministry "Rock the Silence." I also have taken ASL I and ASL II from BCC. I have attended a "silent retreat" sponsored by the Southern Baptist convention and also taken an Interpreter's session led by Carter Beardon, a renowned Deaf Minister.</p>
   <p class="teacherParagraphIndent">I have been sharing my love of sign since I started learning. I have held classes for all ages in a variety of venues. Helped encourage a seniors program in Eglin AFB at Bob Hope Village for my mom. Nearly every year I have the privilege to sign for them. My mother has a signing group and the Bob Hope Village has procured a wonderful person, Anna, to help the seniors learn to communicate in sign.</p>
   <p class="teacherParagraphIndent">I developed and facilitate "Silent Bingo" through the Port St. John Children's Library. Its purpose is to open awareness while having fun of sign language, its benefits and Deaf Culture.</p>
   <p class="teacherParagraphIndent">At our church, Coastal Community Church, we started a signing team of about 7, in which about 4 of us rotate and sign the worship and the message. Our goal is to provide the Deaf with the blessing of options to come and hear the gospel through our church. We have found that the signing has blessed the Hearing and opened up opportunities for them to learn sign language and develop relationships with the Deaf. Our church youth group band even includes a signer, our daughter, as part of their ministry.</p>
