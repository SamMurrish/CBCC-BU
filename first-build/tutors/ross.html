  <h4 class="teacherHeading">Education:</h4>
   <p class="teacherParagraphIndent"> I started my Healthcare career as a certified Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) in the state of Florida in 1984, became a certified Paramedic in 1985, and a Registered Nurse in 1991, with special certifications in critical care (CCRN) and emergency room (CEN). I have been teaching advanced cardiac care courses to healthcare professionals, and basic life support and first aid courses to the general community for over 12 years.</p>
  <h4 class="teacherHeading">Personal Background:</h4>
   <p class="teacherParagraphIndent">As a family we began our homeschooling journey in 2002. Looking back now, I believe the Lord led me to home school for the ultimate benefit of my youngest son, but we as a family have been blessed beyond measure through our homeschooling experiences. I brought my daughter home to school in the 9th grade, and my three boys were preschool, grade 2 and grade 4. Being able to teach my children about our Lord and his creation has been the most wonderful experience, and it has been a tremendous blessing to pass along to my children the love I have for the sciences.</p>
  <h4 class="teacherHeading">Teaching Experience:</h4>
   <p class="teacherParagraphIndent">Three of my four children have graduated from home schooled high school with their AA degree through dual enrollment and continued their education at the university level, one at FAU, one at FSU and one out of state for two years and then back to Florida at FSU (he got tired of the snow!)
   My last son is currently in high school and is dual enrolled as well. I began teaching at the Merritt Island Christian Co-Op in 2010, offering high school Honors Biology, Honors Marine Biology, Honors Anatomy (Advanced Biology), Health, and American Government. I consider it such an honor to be able to help other
   homeschooling families educate their children through the co-op, and I truly enjoy spreading God's word through science and government studies.</p>
