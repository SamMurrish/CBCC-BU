  <p class="teacherParagraphIndent">I have a Bachelor's degree in Elementary Education from the University of Central Florida. I am a certified K-6 teacher with Reading and ESOL Endorsement. I attended Christian Heritage Academy for middle and high school. I also attended co-op as a high school student. I have taught at Lighthouse Christian Academy, Co-op, Endeavour Elementary, and Trinity Lutheran. I have taught K-12th grade. I have also taught children's church for 7 years as well as worked in the church nursery.</p>
  <p class="teacherParagraphIndent">My husband and I have been married for three years. We have one child who was born on our first anniversary. We are actively involved in our church, Coastal Community located in Port Saint John. We also lead a home group for young adults on Thursday nights. I stepped down from teaching Spanish/Science at Trinity so I could have more time at home with my two year old son Isaiah. My husband and I decided that it was time to listen to God and for me to work less outside of the home.</p>
  <p class="teacherParagraphIndent">I have developed knowledge of the Spanish language through school and numerous mission trips to Nicaragua as well as Colombia and Peru. It was such a blessing to spread the gospel and love of Christ to those in other countries especially the villages in Peru who had never seen Americans before.</p>
