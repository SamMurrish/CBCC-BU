 <h4 class="teacherHeading">Professional Snapshot:</h4>
 <p>
During college, I worked in a Rehabilitation Center as an Occupational Therapy Aide.  After graduation, I secured a position as a Licensed Speech-Language Pathology Assistant/Team Leader. My duties included: Clinical treatment of patients with disorders including dysphagia, aphasia, apraxia, aural rehab, dysarthria and dementia. Documentation skills for materials including weekly progress note, monthly summaries, care plans and discharge summaries.  Administered standardized tests. I truly enjoyed patient care!  
<br />
<br />
Because of my passion of health and fitness and the fact that my husband had a successful Personal Training business, I became certified as a personal fitness trainer.  I worked at the RDV Sportsplex in Orlando (The Magic Athletic Club...Premier training facility).
<br />
<br />
In 2000, our first son was born and we moved to South Florida. I was blessed to be able to become a 'stay at home' wife and mom.  I continued to train and teach health and fitness to a small group of women.
<br />
<br />
In 2005, we moved back to my hometown, Melbourne.  My husband rebuilt his business "The Art of Muscle, LLC" from scratch and soared to training 50+ sessions/ week with an excellent reputation in the community. I continue to train a small group in the early mornings before my boys wake up and assist our training business with the administrative duties.

 <h4 class="teacherHeading">Personal Snapshot:</h4>
  <p>
    I was born and raised in Satellite Beach, FL. I met my husband while I was at UCF and we married in 1996.  As we were dating, we fell in love with Jesus and we began building and strengthening our relationship with Him.  We have 3 boys (14yo, 13yo, 10yo).  We have been schooling at home since they were babies.  Primarily because we wanted to build their foundation on Biblical Principals.  We have been blessed to be able to keep Christ in the center of all that we teach.
