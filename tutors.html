 <h5>Professional Snapshot:</h5>
 <p>
During college, I worked in a Rehabilitation Center as an Occupational Therapy Aide.  After graduation, I secured a position as a Licensed Speech-Language Pathology Assistant/Team Leader. My duties included: Clinical treatment of patients with disorders including dysphagia, aphasia, apraxia, aural rehab, dysarthria and dementia. Documentation skills for materials including weekly progress note, monthly summaries, care plans and discharge summaries.  Administered standardized tests. I truly enjoyed patient care!  
<br />
<br />
Because of my passion of health and fitness and the fact that my husband had a successful Personal Training business, I became certified as a personal fitness trainer.  I worked at the RDV Sportsplex in Orlando (The Magic Athletic Club...Premier training facility).
<br />
<br />
In 2000, our first son was born and we moved to South Florida. I was blessed to be able to become a 'stay at home' wife and mom.  I continued to train and teach health and fitness to a small group of women.
<br />
<br />
In 2005, we moved back to my hometown, Melbourne.  My husband rebuilt his business "The Art of Muscle, LLC" from scratch and soared to training 50+ sessions/ week with an excellent reputation in the community. I continue to train a small group in the early mornings before my boys wake up and assist our training business with the administrative duties.
 </p>
 <h5>Personal Snapshot:</h5>
  <p>
    I was born and raised in Satellite Beach, FL. I met my husband while I was at UCF and we married in 1996.  As we were dating, we fell in love with Jesus and we began building and strengthening our relationship with Him.  We have 3 boys (14yo, 13yo, 10yo).  We have been schooling at home since they were babies.  Primarily because we wanted to build their foundation on Biblical Principals.  We have been blessed to be able to keep Christ in the center of all that we teach.

      <div class="collapsible-header avin-content">Pamela Ferraro - Sign Language</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body">
        <h5 style="padding-top:10px; margin-top:0px;">Her Testimony:</h5>
        <p>My husband went to a Ligonier Ministry conference in the early 90's. I stayed home with our baby. When
   he came home and told me about the conference, one of the things he mentioned was that during worship, there was a woman that
   moved her hands like a ballet to the words. I was so touched by his description of the event that I went to the local library,
   checked out a signing dictionary and started teaching myself to sign. My only purpose was for worship songs. I quickly
   discovered that this led me to study the words I was singing to God and to broaden my focus to scripture, everyday life
   vocabulary and teaching our baby girl sign language. This is way before "baby sign." I also found that it helped me to
   remember things through visual & tactical learning.</p>
   <p>One church we attended offered classes and I took the "Joy of Signing" class, which ended in selecting a
   song and signing it for the class. Later, I took a class from the signing ministry "Rock the Silence." I also have taken ASL
   I and ASL II from BCC. I have attended a "silent retreat" sponsored by the Southern Baptist convention and also taken an
   Interpreter's session led by Carter Beardon, a renowned Deaf Minister.</p>
   <p>I have been sharing my love of sign since I started learning. I have held classes for all ages in a
   variety of venues. Helped encourage a seniors program in Eglin AFB at Bob Hope Village for my mom. Nearly every year I have
   the privilege to sign for them. My mother has a signing group and the Bob Hope Village has procured a wonderful person, Anna,
   to help the seniors learn to communicate in sign.</p>
   <p>I developed and facilitate "Silent Bingo" through the Port St. John Children's Library. Its purpose is
   to open awareness while having fun of sign language, its benefits and Deaf Culture.</p>
   <p>At our church, Coastal Community Church, we started a signing team of about 7, in which about 4 of us
   rotate and sign the worship and the message. Our goal is to provide the Deaf with the blessing of options to come and hear
   the gospel through our church. We have found that the signing has blessed the Hearing and opened up opportunities for them
   to learn sign language and develop relationships with the Deaf. Our church youth group band even includes a signer, our
   daughter, as part of their ministry.</p></div>

      <div class="collapsible-header avin-content">Alicia Houlberg - Science</div>
      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>I grew up in a military family and spent the majority of my formative years living in Europe. It was an incredible experience and I am forever grateful to my parents for that opportunity. When my father retired
      from the Air Force we moved back to Florida as both of my parents are Florida Natives. I attended Brevard Community College in Cocoa and earned my Associate of Arts degree and also became a certified Emergency Medical Technician. While attending
      school I met the love of my life, Will. We have been married for almost 18 years and have two sons, Trey and Wesley.</p>
  <p>As newlyweds we lived in Orlando and I found a job that made practical use of my EMT training. I became a supervisor at a medical transcription company and taught myself how to transcribe reports while working the night shift.
  This ability afforded me the opportunity to be both a stay-at-home mom and gainfully employed. Typing emergency room charts kept me interested in medicine and fueled the desire to further my education.</p>
  <p>Our young family moved to Georgia in the fall of 2000 as my husband pursued his career in Engineering. We settled in Newnan just southwest of Atlanta and spent the next decade there. I attended the University of West Georgia and earned a
  Bachelor of Science in Pre- Professional Biology as I aspired to go to medical school. While I did not get accepted at that time into graduate school, my love for science was strengthened and my faith in God the Creator was reaffirmed. With every
  biology, chemistry and physics class that I studied for, God's design for life and a highly ordered universe continued to reveal itself in a most magnificent way. Science is amazing! We are truly fearfully and wonderfully made and the Earth is filled
  with His Glory!</p>
  <p>In February of 2010 we made our way back to Merritt Island. It is our home and we love living here. We have made so many new friends, reconnected with some old ones and are blessed to have so many family members close by.</p>
  <p>Recently, while contemplating a return to graduate school and pondering the ever approaching empty nest stage, I decided that I needed to revisit my college textbooks and refresh my memory. I knew I needed a way to keep my mind sharp and help
  retain all that I had learned as an undergraduate. That very week while at co-op I was asked if I would be interested in teaching Chemistry and General Science! I am incredibly grateful for this teaching opportunity that God has provided and am so
  excited for the upcoming school year.</p>

I attended Christian Heritage Academy for middle and high school. I also attended co-op as a high school student. I have taught at Lighthouse Christian Academy, Co-op, Endeavour Elementary, and Trinity Lutheran. I have taught K-12th grade.

  <p>My husband and I have been married for three years. We have one child who was born on our first anniversary. We are actively involved in our church, Coastal Community located in Port Saint John. We also lead a home group for young adults on Thursday nights. I stepped down from teaching Spanish/Science at Trinity so I could have more time at home with my two year old son Isaiah. My husband and I decided that it was time to listen to God and for me to work less outside of the home.</p>
  <p>I have developed knowledge of the Spanish language through school and numerous mission trips to Nicaragua as well as Colombia and Peru. It was such a blessing to spread the gospel and love of Christ to those in other countries especially the villages in Peru who had never seen Americans before.</p>

  <h5>Personal Background:</h5>
   <p>As a family we began our homeschooling journey in 2002. Looking back now, I believe the Lord led me to home school for the ultimate benefit of my youngest son, but we as a family have been blessed beyond measure through our homeschooling experiences. I brought my daughter home to school in the 9th grade, and my three boys were preschool, grade 2 and grade 4. Being able to teach my children about our Lord and his creation has been the most wonderful experience, and it has been a tremendous blessing to pass along to my children the love I have for the sciences.</p>
  <h5>Teaching Experience:</h5>
   <p>Three of my four children have graduated from home schooled high school with their AA degree through dual enrollment and continued their education at the university level, one at FAU, one at FSU and one out of state for two years and then back to Florida at FSU (he got tired of the snow!)
   My last son is currently in high school and is dual enrolled as well. I began teaching at the Merritt Island Christian Co-Op in 2010, offering high school Honors Biology, Honors Marine Biology, Honors Anatomy (Advanced Biology), Health, and American Government. I consider it such an honor to be able to help other
   homeschooling families educate their children through the co-op, and I truly enjoy spreading God's word through science and government studies.</p>
